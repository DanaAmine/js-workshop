# JavaScript Learning Tasks

## Task 1: Variable Manipulation and Control Flow

- [ ] **Description:** Write a JavaScript program that takes a number as input from the user and checks whether it's even or odd. If it's even, print "The number is even", otherwise print "The number is odd".

## Task 2: Arrays and Loops

- [ ] **Description:** Create an array of numbers. Write a function that takes this array as input and returns the sum of all the numbers in the array.  ( map or reduce not for loop hh)

## Task 3: Functions and Objects

- [ ] **Description:** Create an object representing a car. It should have properties such as make, model, year, and color. Write a function that takes this car object as input and prints out a description of the car.(arrow function not simple)

## Task 4: Asynchronous Programming with Callbacks

- [ ] **Description:** Write a function that simulates fetching data from a server. Use setTimeout to mimic a delay. The function should take a callback function as a parameter and invoke the callback with some dummy data after a certain delay.

## Task 5: Promises

- [ ] **Description:** Extend the previous task to use promises instead of callbacks. Rewrite the function to return a promise that resolves with the dummy data after a delay. Then, use .then() to handle the resolved promise and print the data.
